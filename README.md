# Shopping Cart

A collaborative project between Christian Yarwood (christianyarwood62) and Jordan Leung (swiftybo) to develop a simple shopping cart web application. This main learning outcome of this project was to move past solo developemnt and understand the workflow when working collaboratively with other developers using Git and GitHub.

Throughout the development process, we gained experience with:
- **Branch Management:** Utilising branches to develop components in isolation, ensuring the main codebase remained stable.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Learning to identify, navigate, and resolve merge conflicts efficiently.
- **Version Control Commands:** Practising essential git commands including git pull, git push & git merge to maintain a seamless workflow.
- **Remote Synchronization:** Understanding how to keep our local environments aligned with the remote repository to prevent data loss or code regression.

## 🚀 Overview

This project displays food items which can be added to a basket. This basket can be opened in a separate page to view all the products which have been added. Most recently the product list has been updated to come from the US Department of Agriculture API. Note that the API is currently only searching for "alcohol" to limit the number of returned results.
