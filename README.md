# Project Title: Shopping Cart

A collaborative project between Christian Yarwood (christianyarwood62) and Jordan Leung (swiftybo) to develop a simple shopping cart web application. This project was primarily to understand the workflow when working collaboratively using Git and GitHub. This project has taught us key features including branches, merging conflicts and using GitHub as our "Source of Truth". Additionally, we have learned how to use commands like "git merge", "git pull" and "git push" together with branches to keep our "Source of Truth" clean. 


## 🚀 Overview
This project displays food items which can be added to a basket. This basket can be opened in a separate page to view all the products which have been added. Most recently the product list has been updated to come from the US Department of Agriculture API. (This change has broken some of the features in the web application including stock count & price. Note that the API is currently only searching for "cheese" to limit the number of returned results.)
